In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot. The film is set in Kumbakonam and I play the owner of a santhai. We’ve finished shooting for the film and the post production work is going on in full swing. The team is looking for a July-August release.”


Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing. But, over time, I was able to pick up.” Dharan has composed music for the film, and this will be his 25th film as a composer."

20,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
21,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

26,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

30,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

31,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

312,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

363,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it.

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

After being part of two hits this year – Kumbalangi Nights and Ishq – it’s no wonder that the bigwigs from other industries are taking note of the young talent.

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights. Nitish had earlier waxed eloquent about Fahadh Faasil’s performance in movies such as Maheshinte Prathikaaram, Njan Prakashan and Kumbalangi Nights as well."

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot. The film is set in Kumbakonam and I play the owner of a santhai. We’ve finished shooting for the film and the post production work is going on in full swing. The team is looking for a July-August release.”


Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing.

520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

526,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

627,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

812,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

863,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

In a recent interview with Filmfare, the diva opened up on dealing with fears and anxieties when she was quizzed if she has ever discussed these problems like other Bollywood celebs. She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

After being part of two hits this year – Kumbalangi Nights and Ishq – it’s no wonder that the bigwigs from other industries are taking note of the young talent.

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights. Nitish had earlier waxed eloquent about Fahadh Faasil’s performance in movies such as Maheshinte Prathikaaram, Njan Prakashan and Kumbalangi Nights as well."

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

979,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

1000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot.

Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together.

1020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
1021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

1026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

1031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

1036,"Created: May 31, 2019, 01:32 IST",-,TV,Trouble in the Roadies Real Heroes' paradise? Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

1127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

1130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

1220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

1271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

1273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

1312,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

1363,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it.

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights.

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

1479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

1500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing.

1520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
1521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

1530,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

1531,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

1627,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

1630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

1720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

1771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

1773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

1812,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

1863,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

Salman and Katrina's will again be seen weaving their magic on the silver screen once again with their sizzling chemistry. The film which is based on a South Korean film, 'Ode to My Father' will also feature Jackie Shroff, Sunil Grover and Nora Fatehi in prominent roles."

1903,-,-,-,-,"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray indicated on Thursday that his party may continue to remain non-aligned and fight all seats on its own for the state assembly elections later this year. While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

1981,Sankha Ghosh,Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"‘Ahaa Re’ completes 100 days, Ranjan happy with the overwhelming response","Ranjan Ghosh’s latest offering ‘Ahaa Re’ successfully touched the 100 days mark at the box office organically. In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."
1982,Himesh Mankad,-,Entertainment,Prabhudheva's back with hit song 'Mukkala Muqabala' after 25 years,"Twenty-five years ago, 'Mukkala Muqabala' from his 1994 Tamil film, 'Kadhalan' (dubbed in Hindi as 'Humse Hai Muqabala') made Prabhudheva a national craze. Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

2000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together.

2020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
2021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

2026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

2030,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

2031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

2130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

2220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

2271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

2273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

Not only them but even the director of the film Ali Abbas Zafar along with actress Disha Patani, who plays a pivotal role in the film have been busy interacting with the media.

In a recent interview with Filmfare, the diva opened up on dealing with fears and anxieties when she was quizzed if she has ever discussed these problems like other Bollywood celebs. She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights.

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

2470,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:50 IST",-,TV,Radha Ramana: Rani's character to conclude its journey,"Radha Ramana is definitely one of the most watched daily soap on Kannada television. Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

2479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

2481,Sankha Ghosh,Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"‘Ahaa Re’ completes 100 days, Ranjan happy with the overwhelming response","Ranjan Ghosh’s latest offering ‘Ahaa Re’ successfully touched the 100 days mark at the box office organically. In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

2500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

2520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
2521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

2526,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

2530,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

2531,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

2627,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

2630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

2720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

2771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

2773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

2812,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

2863,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

2979,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

2981,Sankha Ghosh,Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"‘Ahaa Re’ completes 100 days, Ranjan happy with the overwhelming response","Ranjan Ghosh’s latest offering ‘Ahaa Re’ successfully touched the 100 days mark at the box office organically. In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

3000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing.

3020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
3021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

3026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

3030,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

3031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

3127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

3130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

3220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

3271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

3273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

3363,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

In a recent interview with Filmfare, the diva opened up on dealing with fears and anxieties when she was quizzed if she has ever discussed these problems like other Bollywood celebs. She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

3403,-,-,-,-,"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray indicated on Thursday that his party may continue to remain non-aligned and fight all seats on its own for the state assembly elections later this year. While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights. Nitish had earlier waxed eloquent about Fahadh Faasil’s performance in movies such as Maheshinte Prathikaaram, Njan Prakashan and Kumbalangi Nights as well."

Kalyani notices coffins kept in the graveyard and Malhar wonders if Atharva had locked Anupriya in the coffin. They check the coffins but they are empty. A car arrives there. Kalyani and Malhar hide in the coffin. Atharva walks out of the car.


He knocks on the coffin in which Kalyani and Malhar are hiding and leaves from there. Malhar and Kalyani come out of the coffin and hear a sound. They break the lock and find a tape recorder inside. Kalyani finds Anupriya's bangle and realises that she was there and Atharva had moved her from there. She cries as Malhar tries to console her. Kalyani is resting when Atharva arrives and tells her that he will punish Anupriya as Kalyani told everything to Malhar about his plan. Kalyani pleads to Atharva to be sensitive.

Atharva smiles and asks her to be a part of the rituals. The next day Kalyani tells Malhar that they need to stop meeting each other and look out for evidence against Atharva in their own way.

She says she has no choice but to marry Atharva. Malhar promises to rescue Anupriya.


Atul receives water cans and he tries to carry the can and calls for help. When he returns, he sees that the cans are missing. He sees Malhar keeping the cans inside.


Kalyani comes for the rituals and Malhar looks at her. A neighbour enquires about Anupriya to which Aao Saheb says that she is in Kashi.

Aao Saheb asks Kalyani to do as Atharva says and reminds her of Anupriya being with Atharva. Atharva admires Kalyani and Malhar warns him not to misbehave with Kalyani.


The rituals begin. Kalyani sees a message on Atharva's phone about moving Anupriya to a different location. Kalyani messages Malhar about the same and that they will have to check Atharva's phone to know the details."

3435,Melissa D’costa,Melissa D’costa,Lifestyle,Winning at Twinning,"Floating in a cloud of tulle, Priyanka Chopra Jonas floored netizens with her pristine white layered gown at a recent appearance at Cannes. She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

3479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

3500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot.

The team is looking for a July-August release.”


Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing.

3520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
3521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

3526,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

3530,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

3531,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

3627,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

3630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

3720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

3771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.


Here is what dancer Rupanshi Kashyap has to say after the premiere of play 'Yuyutsu'

3773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

3812,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

3863,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it.

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

After being part of two hits this year – Kumbalangi Nights and Ishq – it’s no wonder that the bigwigs from other industries are taking note of the young talent.

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights. Nitish had earlier waxed eloquent about Fahadh Faasil’s performance in movies such as Maheshinte Prathikaaram, Njan Prakashan and Kumbalangi Nights as well."

3935,Melissa D’costa,Melissa D’costa,Lifestyle,Winning at Twinning,"Floating in a cloud of tulle, Priyanka Chopra Jonas floored netizens with her pristine white layered gown at a recent appearance at Cannes. She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

3979,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

4000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot. The film is set in Kumbakonam and I play the owner of a santhai. We’ve finished shooting for the film and the post production work is going on in full swing. The team is looking for a July-August release.”


Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing.

4020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
4021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

4026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

4031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

4127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

4130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

4220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

4271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

4273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

4312,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

4363,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights. Nitish had earlier waxed eloquent about Fahadh Faasil’s performance in movies such as Maheshinte Prathikaaram, Njan Prakashan and Kumbalangi Nights as well."

4435,Melissa D’costa,Melissa D’costa,Lifestyle,Winning at Twinning,"Floating in a cloud of tulle, Priyanka Chopra Jonas floored netizens with her pristine white layered gown at a recent appearance at Cannes. She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

4479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

4500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot.

Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together.

4520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
4521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

4526,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

4531,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

4536,"Created: May 31, 2019, 01:32 IST",-,TV,Trouble in the Roadies Real Heroes' paradise? Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

4627,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

4630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

4720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

4771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

4773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

4812,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

4863,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Recently, according to reports, the actor revealed that he got an offer to be part of a Bollywood film, which is directed by Nitish Tiwari, who had helmed Dangal. Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights.

4935,Melissa D’costa,Melissa D’costa,Lifestyle,Winning at Twinning,"Floating in a cloud of tulle, Priyanka Chopra Jonas floored netizens with her pristine white layered gown at a recent appearance at Cannes. She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

4979,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

4981,Sankha Ghosh,Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"‘Ahaa Re’ completes 100 days, Ranjan happy with the overwhelming response","Ranjan Ghosh’s latest offering ‘Ahaa Re’ successfully touched the 100 days mark at the box office organically. In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

5000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together.

5020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
5021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

5026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

5030,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

5031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

5127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

5130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

5220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

5271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

5273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

5363,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one.

Not only them but even the director of the film Ali Abbas Zafar along with actress Disha Patani, who plays a pivotal role in the film have been busy interacting with the media.

In a recent interview with Filmfare, the diva opened up on dealing with fears and anxieties when she was quizzed if she has ever discussed these problems like other Bollywood celebs. She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

Salman and Katrina's will again be seen weaving their magic on the silver screen once again with their sizzling chemistry. The film which is based on a South Korean film, 'Ode to My Father' will also feature Jackie Shroff, Sunil Grover and Nora Fatehi in prominent roles."

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

5479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

5481,Sankha Ghosh,Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"‘Ahaa Re’ completes 100 days, Ranjan happy with the overwhelming response","Ranjan Ghosh’s latest offering ‘Ahaa Re’ successfully touched the 100 days mark at the box office organically. In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

5500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

5520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
5521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

5526,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

5530,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

5531,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

5630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

5720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

5771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

5773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

Not only them but even the director of the film Ali Abbas Zafar along with actress Disha Patani, who plays a pivotal role in the film have been busy interacting with the media.

In a recent interview with Filmfare, the diva opened up on dealing with fears and anxieties when she was quizzed if she has ever discussed these problems like other Bollywood celebs. She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights.

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

5979,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

5981,Sankha Ghosh,Sankha Ghosh,Entertainment,"‘Ahaa Re’ completes 100 days, Ranjan happy with the overwhelming response","Ranjan Ghosh’s latest offering ‘Ahaa Re’ successfully touched the 100 days mark at the box office organically. In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

6000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

6020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
6021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

6026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

6030,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

6031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

6127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

6130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

6220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

6271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

6273,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

6312,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:42 IST",-,Entertainment,"Democracy gives you right to ask a question: Anurag Kashyap on being dissenter, dealing with trolls","A democracy gives you the right to ask a question, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said on Thursday after he was trolled for drawing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attention to a social media post threatening his daughter with rape because of his anti-establishment views. Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

6363,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it. Whoever is running this Universe has got your back. Put out what you want. Discard any thought that's not constructive.""

While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Nitish is currently helming the Sushant Singh Rajput-starrer Chhichhore, which is a coming-of-age tale about a group of college friends.


The actor revealed that he was offered the part of a Malayali student in the film but had to opt out as it clashed with the dates of Kumbalangi Nights.

She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks.

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

6479,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

Now, it has learnt that the iconic song has been recreated for Remo D’souza’s upcoming musical, 'Street Dancer 3D', with Tanishk Bagchi reworking the AR Rahman original.

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

6500,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot.

Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together.

6520,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
6521,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

6526,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

6530,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

6531,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

6627,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

6630,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

6720,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

6771,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

6773,"Created: May 31, 2019, 08:00 IST",-,Lifestyle,Foods that you must avoid eating on an empty stomach,"What you eat early morning decides the course of your day, in simple words it can either make or break your day. Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."

Kashyap said there should be a law against this kind of trolling, or someone in power should condemn such incidents ""in the harshest words"" to send across a strong message.
The filmmaker has filed an FIR against the troll who posted the abusive post about him and his daughter.

""A democracy gives you the right to ask a question. If I am intimidated for asking a question and later subjected to multiple attacks, I don't find such an atmosphere right,"" Kashyap told.
The director hit the headlines last week when he drew Modi's attention to a right wing troll, who had abused and threatened his daughter with rape for his views.

The director of films such as 'Dev D' and 'Gangs of Wasseypur', who is known to be vocal about his opinions, said he is worried about ""the atmosphere of fear, which has emerged"".

""I am asked 'Don't you get scared while speaking against the government?'... I shouldn't be scared to ask a question,"" he said during the promotion of a new film, 'Game Over'.

Kashyap said he is not scared about threats when they are directed at him but, as a father, he needs to reassure his child.


""I don't mind that the prime minister I didn't support won. This is a public mandate and I accept it. I have always fought with governments,"" he said, citing the example of the bans on his films during the Congress regime.


""I don't fight the party, I fight the government because you live in a country, you vote and you can have a contrary opinion and that can co-exist... I just don't agree with the PM but that doesn't mean I will say something and he doesn't get elected on the basis of what I say. If he comes somewhere, I will stand in respect the way others would.""


According to Kashyap, trolling has not stopped despite the prime minister, in the past, saying such things should not happen.


""I know if a man says this strongly and strictly that such things shouldn't happen and this will be punishable, these things will automatically stop..."""

6863,Narayan Namboodiri,Narayan Namboodiri,TV,Four arrested for attack on woman who accused Karan Oberoi of rape,"Following the early morning attack last week on the woman who has accused TV actor Karan Oberoi of raping her, the Oshiwara police late on Thursday arrested four youths. One of the four is a distant relative of the victim’s lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan, deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

Senior inspector of Oshiwara police Shailesh Pasalwar said, “We are probing whether the lawyer has got any role in the attack.” DCP Singh Dahiya said they had tried calling the lawyer but “his mobile phone was found to have been switched off on Thursday.” TOI tried to contact the woman’s lawyer via calls and text messages, but his mobile was switched off. The woman too did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. The four youths were picked up from different locations at Andheri and Mira Road, DCP Singh Dahiya said.


Last Saturday, the woman had gone for a morning walk in Andheri (W) when, between 5.45am and 6am, two unidentified bike-borne men slashed her arm with a paper cutter. They then threw a chit at the spot with the words “Take back the case” scribbled on it.

In her police complaint following the attack, the woman had stated, “I am undergoing treatment for depression and my doctor has advised morning walks. On Saturday, I left home at 5.40am and took an auto-rickshaw to Lokhandwala Circle. From there, I walked towards the Millat Nagar back road to reach Yamuna Nagar junction and Joggers Park, where two men on a bike began to follow me. They attacked me and threw a chit with ‘Take back the case’ scribbled on it.” She said the bikers appeared to be aware of her schedule.


Cops scanned at least 100 CCTVs in the region and, based on details of the bike they had gathered, picked up one Jishan Ansari (23). His arrest led to his brother Altamas Ansari (22) and their two aides, Jatin Santosh (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali


(21). Police are looking for the person who asked these four to carry out the attack. All the four are college students. “The Ansari brothers are planners. While Ali rode Jishan’s bike, Santosh was the pillion-rider who attacked the victim and threw the chit,” the police said."

Kishori reads the instructions of the task, according to which Rupali had to convince Neha and Parag had to convince Shivani to wear a slate which reads ‘I am not suitable to be in Bigg Boss’.
Neha puts a condition for the team that if she agrees to do the task, then they have to make her the captain.

On hearing that, Abhijeet Bichukale gets confused and says that he needs more time to decide as he is the leader of the team. This makes Neha angry and she starts shouting at Abhijeet.
On the other hand, Parag and his teammates tell Shivani to convince Neha to not do the task. But Shivani doesn’t agree to it. Parag tells Vaishali, who is his team’s leader that there is no teamwork between them and thus he doesn’t like Vaishali, Shivani, and Veena.

Neha gets a little upset due to Abhijeet’s behaviour. When she starts crying, everyone tries to convince her.

Vaishali tells Veena that Parag doesn’t like her which makes her (Veena) furious as she is doing the task to make him safe. Veena shares this with Rupali. Later, Rupali discusses it with Parag and gets the misunderstandings sorted. When Parag gets to know that Veena is upset with him, he writes an apology note for her.

Later, Bigg Boss announces the names of the nominated contestants and those who are safe.

At midnight, Abhijeet tries to share his strategy with Neha, Madhav, and Maithili which they don't like.


Next morning, Neha raises her voice at Abhijeet and blames him for not making her safe. Rupali too lashes out at Abhijeet for creating misunderstanding between the team.


When he tries to tell his point to Kishori, she too advises him to not speak anything about anyone in the absence of that person.


Lastly, when Shivani goes to the kitchen, she tells everyone that she doesn’t know how to make the Palak Khichdi and thus she is making a normal one. On that, Abhijeet comes ahead to tell her that she should take everyone’s opinion on this. But Shivani starts shouting at him. This irritates Veena and she leaves from the kitchen.


Shivani and Veena start arguing with each other. Veena says that Shivani shouldn’t have shouted in the kitchen area whereas Shivani justifies her actions to be valid."

She replied saying ""Everyone has their own battles and their own way to overcome them. Like Alia (Bhatt) has spoken about the anxiety she faces at times and said that it's okay to not be okay. This is an important statement. Deepika (Padukone) has spoken about her battle with depression and how she reached out to certain people, who helped her.""


Furthermore, she added, ""In my case, books and other things helped me understand not to be a slave to every thought that comes to your mind or every emotion you feel. You don't need to crumble under the pressure. This complex crazy Universe is not running because of you and me. It's running on its own. Have faith in it.

6903,-,-,-,-,"Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray indicated on Thursday that his party may continue to remain non-aligned and fight all seats on its own for the state assembly elections later this year. While former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre met Raj yesterday to convince him to come on board, MNS chief’s meeting with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday had triggered speculation of a possible alliance between MNS and Congress-NCP combine.

According to a senior MNS functionary, the party is planning to adopt Jaganmohan Reddy’s model from Andhra Pradesh and continue to remain non-aligned, though it may still strike a deal with Congress-NCP for a share of at least 20-25 seats. “We are looking to fight the seats with our own candidates and stand a good chance as we will attack the failures of the state government. There is real space for an anti-government party and Rajsaheb can use that space. We will have to do it strategically and not be seen as a partner of the Congress-NCP combine, though,” the functionary said.

It is learned that Pawar was keen on getting Raj on board despite the MNS factor failing in the Lok Sabha elections. According to insiders, even the Congress is now ready to join hands, even though it had opposed the MNS’s entry before the general election. Though prior to the Lok Sabha election, Sharad Pawar had seen lack of MNS candidates as the reason for not being of any direct value, after the verdict he indicated that Congress-NCP combine could do well with MNS as well. “It won’t be right to say that the Congress-NCP didn’t get any advantage because of Raj’s rallies. The picture would have been different had MNS’s candidates fought the elections,” he had said.

Despite attracting huge crowds with his data and fact-checking videos at nine election rallies across the state and three in Mumbai alone, Raj’s party had failed to win even a single seat in the city. In fact, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won in seven out of the 11 locations where he had held rallies.

MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande blamed the Congress-NCP for failing to take advantage of the ‘atmosphere’ created by Raj. “They couldn’t even tackle their own leaders like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Vijay Sinh Mohite-Patil. You can’t hold the MNS responsible for the loss,” Deshpande said. On Thursday, even rebel BJP legislator from Dhule, Anil Gote, met Raj at his Dadar residence.

A section of Congress and NCP leaders, however, feel that further efforts should be made to accommodate MNS and Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi for dislodging the BJP-Shiv Sena government. “Congress-NCP lost at least 11 seats owing to VBA nominees. We must persuade Ambedkar to join hands with us and accommodate MNS as well,” a Congress leader said."

A 32-year-old techie working in a reputed firm sought refuge in his neighbour’s house to save himself after he was chased and beaten up by a gang of five over a parking row in Battarahalli on Monday. The techie, Sandeep S, had parked his car on the road outside his house in Vinayaka Layout in Virgo Nagar, when two persons passing by on a two-wheeler started honking, demanding that the car be moved from their path.

Sandeep came out and told them that there was enough space for the two-wheeler to pass. As the fight escalated, the accused punched Sandeep on his head and torso. They also beat him up with a stick. To save himself, the victim ran inside his neighbour’s house and locked himself up. The accused had damaged Sandeep’s mobile phone so the neighbour offered him his mobile to call his family members for help. Sandeep and his wife have been staying at the Vinayaka Layout house since April 27 this year. The KR Puram police have registered a case.

Sandeep was alerted by the relentless honking outside his house; when he came downstairs, two bikers asked him to remove his car

The brouhaha began around 10.20 pm on Monday, when Sandeep had just returned from his in-laws’ house and was relaxing at home. He heard someone honking and came out to check what was going on. He saw two persons on a bike who asked him to move his car. One of the two spoke rudely and threatened to break the car’s glass.

Before he could take the car out, the rider managed to pass by. By then three others had joined the two on the bike, and they attacked Sandeep, who fell on to the road and shouted for help.

Sandeep told them there was enough space for them to pass; an argument ensued

“My son usually parks his car near his in-laws’ house, which is in the vicinity. He had taken the car to his house to pick us from a bus stop as we were going to attend a wedding from Punganuru in Andhra Pradesh. Three of the five persons, who are said to be locals, targeted my son for no rhyme or reason. Despite there being enough space for their two-wheeler to pass, they created problems. My son had to run inside a neighbour’s house or else the matter would have worsened. He got treatment after the assault and we have given the details to the police,” the victim’s father S Bojanala told Mirror.


The bikers then started thrashing him and the techie had to run into a neighbour’s house

The victim who said he almost fell unconscious, managed to call his brother-in-law, who rushed to the spot. He has given the medical report from the hospital where he was treated as proof.


Once inside, he used the neighbour’s phone to inform his family and seek help

“The victim claims it was an intentional quarrel as he was not at fault. He has further stated that he is facing a threat to his life from the accused. Three of the five accused, identified as Vasu, Dixit and another minor boy, have been arrested. A search is on for the other two,” said an officer.

The KR Puram police have registered a case of causing hurt (IPC 323) and criminal intimidation (IPC 506) against the accused."

Missing for over six years, 16-yearold Chandan Sharma has finally reunited with his family thanks to the Railway Childline team and SATHI, a non-governmental organisation. Chandan had left his home in Ludhiana in search of his younger brother who was missing and accidentally boarded a Punebound train. After reaching the city he was in a state of shock and could not remember his whereabouts.

SATHI got in touch with a young Chandan back in 2013 and produced him before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Chandan was unclear where his house was and thus CWC ordered to admit him in a childrens home in Shivajinagar. Chandan stayed there for three years before being moved to another facility in Manchar.

While at the Manchar facility, Chandan got into a fight with other inmates and later took off from the location. He allegedly walked for two days and reached Pune station along with two other boys. He was once again contacted by SATHI and produced in front of the CWC which ordered authorities to trace his family.

While being counselled by the CWC, Chandan revealed the names of his uncle and aunt who live Kolkata. SATHI and the Railway Childline team then contacted a few local leaders in Kolkata who directed the query to Kolkata police. Thankfully, Chandan’s uncle and aunt too had lodged a missing person complaint in Kolkata and the police were able to verify details provided by SATHI.

Chandan’s family was tracked down in Ludhiana where his father now drives an auto rickshaw tailor while his mother works in a factory. Chandan was studying in Army Public School in Ludhiana before he left his house.

When speaking to Mirror, Chandan Sharma said, “It is an overwhelming feeling now that I am reunited with my family. I don’t remember them very clearly and it feels like a new beginning, a feeling that I am meeting a new family altogether. I am excited to go back home and meet my siblings and it is going to be a new atmosphere. Staying in Pune has taught me a lot of things that will stay with me for life. I am also familiar with Marathi now.”

Talking about the hardships faced by the Sharma family after Chandan went missing, his father Laxmi Narayan Sharma said, “We travelled all places across Punjab looking for our child, we went to the extent of approaching sadhus and held several ‘poojas’ hoping to be reunited with Chandan. We lost all our money in the process of looking for him, I left my tailoring job and now drive an auto rickshaw as I thought that maybe one day I will find my child while driving around the city.”

The family will now be taking Chandan back to Ludhiana to start off a fresh life. His parents said Chandan will continue his education there and will appear for Class X board examination from his hometown."

Last week the film was screened at the 18 th Imagine India Film Festival in Madrid and now Indraadip has won the Best Debut Director award at the prestigious international film fest. An elated Indraadip thanked his entire team and reserved a special thanks to Kaushik Ganguly who playing the lead in ‘Kedara’ has delivered a superb performance.
“I am so happy to see ‘Kedara’ receiving such prestigious festival laurels. I am simply overwhelmed to see ‘Kedara’ receiving so much love. I have received so many congratulatory messages. Thanks to all for supporting me. Now I am eagerly looking forward to release my film at theatres. If all goes according to plan, ‘Kedara’ will release in August,” said an elated Indraadip.


‘Kedara’ which will also be screened at the 3 rd Bengaluru Bengali Kannada Film Festival next month narrates the story of a feeble man Narasingha (Kaushik Ganguly) who lives in a decrepit ancestral house. He is alone without a kin or care and is separated from his wife, albeit undivorced. Scorned by the maid and neighbourhood ruffians, our docile protagonist whiles away his days by striking up fictitious dialogues with carefully chosen people from his past. To add credibility to his daily conversations, he mimics the voices of his imagined guests with remarkable accuracy.


His friend Keshto (Rudranil Ghosh) presents him with an armchair, something he had always coveted to possess. The wooden armchair acts as a catalyst and brings about a transformation in his personality. It restores his confidence and adds bravado to his essence. But this transformation comes at the cost of his sanity, leading to a series of misfortunes and unexpected turns."

Kalyani and Malhar hide in the coffin. Atharva walks out of the car.


He knocks on the coffin in which Kalyani and Malhar are hiding and leaves from there. Malhar and Kalyani come out of the coffin and hear a sound. They break the lock and find a tape recorder inside. Kalyani finds Anupriya's bangle and realises that she was there and Atharva had moved her from there. She cries as Malhar tries to console her. Kalyani is resting when Atharva arrives and tells her that he will punish Anupriya as Kalyani told everything to Malhar about his plan. Kalyani pleads to Atharva to be sensitive.

Atharva smiles and asks her to be a part of the rituals. The next day Kalyani tells Malhar that they need to stop meeting each other and look out for evidence against Atharva in their own way.

She says she has no choice but to marry Atharva. Malhar promises to rescue Anupriya.


Atul receives water cans and he tries to carry the can and calls for help. When he returns, he sees that the cans are missing. He sees Malhar keeping the cans inside.


Kalyani comes for the rituals and Malhar looks at her. A neighbour enquires about Anupriya to which Aao Saheb says that she is in Kashi.

Aao Saheb asks Kalyani to do as Atharva says and reminds her of Anupriya being with Atharva. Atharva admires Kalyani and Malhar warns him not to misbehave with Kalyani.


The rituals begin. Kalyani sees a message on Atharva's phone about moving Anupriya to a different location. Kalyani messages Malhar about the same and that they will have to check Atharva's phone to know the details."

6935,Melissa D’costa,Melissa D’costa,Lifestyle,Winning at Twinning,"Floating in a cloud of tulle, Priyanka Chopra Jonas floored netizens with her pristine white layered gown at a recent appearance at Cannes. She was joined by her husband Nick Jonas, who matched step and synced style in a white suit. The duo managed to grab eyeballs and make a fashion statement on a global platform. This is not the first time Nickyanka have impressed fans with their twinning style. And while it’s the norm to opt for matching bridal outfits for a Big Fat Indian Wedding, it’s also a go-to style option for couples, who want to stand out.
Getting the couple look right!
While Nickyanka have been experimenting pulling off twinning styles both on and off the red carpet, back home, Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar pulled of another black ensemble recently. Farhan chose a bandhgala jacket with a black kurta and white pyjama, Shibani matched his style with a black-and-white dress. Previously, Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani, too, have been spotted in white, while Shahid Kapoor and his wife Mira matched in monochrome outfits. Clearly, the ‘couple look’ is here to stay.


Why couples choose to twin? When celebrity couples like Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna turn out in colour co-ordinated outfits or matching styles, it helps them stand out together. It also gives them a chance to bond and express their love for each other without overdoing the PDA (public display of affection).

From his ‘n’ hers to mom ‘n’ me

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have nailed the his ‘n’ her look. The duo, over the years have been spotted in colour co-ordinated outfits. Black has always been their chosen hue for multiple occasions. Ash not only syncs style with Abhishek, but has also made it a point to match outfits and colours with daughter Aaradhya, who has accompanied her for many red carpet events. Their appearances at Cannes have always generated a lot of buzz online. This time, Ash opted for a dual-toned metallic hued fish-cut dress in golden-green. The metallic hue rubbed off on Aaradhya’s yellow frock, creating a similar contrast of colours.


Hollywood celebrities who bagged his ‘n’ her styles

Yoko Ono and John Lennon can be credited with practically kick-starting the trend in Hollywood, with their matching all-white airport arrival looks. A-list celebs like Victoria and David Beckham have always managed to pull-off his ‘n’ her styles practically mastering it. The duo continue to impress, and were recently spotted wearing black and white pants looking chic at The Portrait Gala in March. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski clearly gave them tough competition with their matching styles. The celeb couple turned out in black and white two-pieces at the 2019 Writers Guild Awards, back in February. Blunt made a stylish appearance in a suit and heels and Krasinski chose a black velvet tux. Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, too, opted for a couple look at Paris Fashion Week, in black and grey outfits.


Did you know?

Keo-peul-look or Couple look is a huge phenomenon in South Korea. The idea is to celebrate young, innocent love. There are dedicated Instagram hashtags that celebrate it like #couplelook. Since PDA is frowned upon, couples express their love, stepping out together in colour co-ordinated outfits and matching looks. Newly-weds there are especially taken with it."

I've not just sung, but also spoken shayari in it, which was a new experience for me. I have grown up listening to Euphoria’s music, so working with them was special,” says Akriti.


Talking about the experience of being in the studio with Palash, she adds, “Working with Palash da has been nothing short of fun. His energy and good vibes fill the room and make you feel wonderful. He gave me full freedom to create that part with him to sing in the middle of the song. I’ve known him for many years and there are very few who are so genuine and supportive and appreciative of your journey.”

Talking about the experience of working on the track, Palash says, “A lot of heart and soul was involved in making this one. The song came together on its own. I feel that we were just a medium. Everything was so organic that we learnt a lot of things from the process. Then Akriti came in and took it to another level. I don't know anyone else who would have delivered the spoken part on this level. It was fun to see it come to life in front of my eyes.”


For Palash, the song is special it’s the band’s first Punjabi song after their chartbuster, Maaeri. “It represents the real beauty of the Punjabi language and culture, which has been misinterpreted by a lot of people in a lot of ways. Also, I think it’s the simplicity and honesty in this one. It is about pure love and doesn’t objectify or misrepresent women. Euphoria has always told a story that comes straight from the heart and we have an audience that stands by our side. We don’t get a million views per day like big Bollywood songs, but for us, the wait is worth it,” he says."

Thanks to its eventual revelation of secrets, the makers have managed to entertain the audience with its narrative storytelling. Now the makers have decided to put an end to Rani's character in the show.
As per the story, Rani enters Raman's life in disguise of his lost sister and introduces herself as Avani (Raman's sister). This is apparently a part of Sitara's plan, who is Raman's paternal aunt.

She manages to win the hearts of the family members and make them believe that she is their lost daughter. She has often claimed herself to be very smart and intelligent in the show.
The story took a different shape when Radha (protagonist) grows suspicious over Rani and decides to trace her roots. Rani tries her to manipulate the family members and succeed but little did she knew that she has already fallen for Raman's trap.


The story of Avani ends with her accepting the truth and the family members send her to jail.


Interestingly, the character of Rani has been played by the charming actress Ashitha Chandrappa. The actress became a household name and the viewers enjoyed every bit of Ashitha's presence on-screen. In fact, her on-screen stints were much appreciated by the critic.


As per the latest reports, Rani's character had given a good lead to the story and the show has also been scoring well on the TRP charts. But changes in the upcoming TRP is likely to be affected as the makers have decided to end Rani's character, sources suggest.


On the other hand, fans have been disappointed with the end of the character. Especially, Ashita's fans are reportedly calling it unfair."

6979,"Created: May 31, 2019, 10:55 IST",-,Entertainment,"From outdoor locations to indoor shoots, D-Town takes fire safety seriously","The Surat fire tragedy has been a rude wake up call for everyone in Gujarat. And as conversations revolve around fire safety, film sets gain attention as they are usually more vulnerable to fire incidences because of the equipment, electric wires and inflammable material lying around. In the absence of proper film studios in the state, most Gujarati films are shot on real locations, making them even more vulnerable. Shooting at crowded places like the old city areas in Ahmedabad or Vadodara or the pol houses pose a difficult challenge for the film crew to ensure fire safety. Other locations like hospitals, educational institutes, amusement parks, warehouses or residential areas where Gujarati films are shot, pose their own set of challenges when it comes to maintaining fire safety measures. We spoke to Gujarati filmmakers, actors and line producers to find out how Dhollywood production houses ensure a fire safe shooting experience for the cast and crew.
Proper fire safety plan, fire safety gear, doctor on call must, say filmmakers

Fire safety is not just about having enough fire extinguishers on the set, but also about having a proper fire safety plan depending on the location. From proper official permissions (from the city police, traffic police, fire officers, local municipal bodies or gram panchayats in case the location is a small village/town, Archeological Survey of India etc), inspecting the location, charting out safety plans, strategically placing fire safety gear within approachable distance, providing adequate training to crew members, ensuring enough fire exits, primary first aid facilities on the set and a doctor on call are few things film crews take care of while shooting.

Unlike film studios that have proper fire safety systems, real locations pose a tougher challenge, say industry insiders. “Safety of our cast and crew members is always our prime concern,” says line producer Kiran Patel, who has worked on Sharato Lagu and Reva. He adds, “There is a dedicated team on each film set that only takes care of fire safety and other measures to ensure no accidents occur. In case something goes wrong, the unit is prepared to handle it immediately. We create an exhaustive plan of action for crisis situations and dedicated budget is also kept aside.”

Film crews also ensure that they tick all the right boxes when it comes to fire safety. Filmmaker Vipul Mehta who faced a minor fire incidence while shooting a sequence for Chaal Jivie Laiye in a city hospital, says, “A spark in one of the lights turned the sprinklers on. But my team of trained individuals was able to immediately bring everything under control.” While curious onlookers gathered to watch the shoot add to the challenge for film crews during outdoor shoots, cramped spaces or not having proper fire exits sure make indoor shoots a tough task. Says filmmaker Abhishek Jain, “Indoor shoots require a thorough check of the location. We should have a proper evacuation plan. For every indoor shoot, we ensure there are enough fire extinguishers and a water storage plan.” Some crews take a safer approach by choosing locations that are spacious and more manageable. Filmmaker Neeraj Joshi says, “If a shot needs an indoor location, we prefer spacious locations where we can not only accommodate our crew members and the equipment but also evacuate the premise in case of fire” ‘Lack of studios and high-end equipment lead to production cost escalating’

The state government offers incentives and sops to shoot in Gujarat, which in turn has attracted a number of filmmakers to shoot here. However, the state doesn’t have too many fully functional studios. Most studios that were functional till a few years back, have either shut shop or get limited business. And this lack of proper facilities not only escalate production cost, but also force filmmakers to compromise on their vision, feel some industry insiders. “Shooting in real outdoor locations is not only costly, but also scores low on safety aspect,” says filmmaker Mayur Kachhadiya, who recently shot his film in Kutch. He adds, “The lack of a film association who will address our issues/present it to the state government has its own set of challenges. From hiring crew members to safety equipment, everything has to be done from our end. Most hi-end equipments have to be hired from Mumbai which results in an increase of the overall production cost.”

Having a proper film studio would not only mean working in a controlled environment, but also cutting costs of buying expensive equipment and transportation. Director Mikhil Musale says, “When you shoot in a studio, you can control safety, sound, light and even unwanted intruders. Since, we don’t have any such facilities in Gujarat, shooting is a tougher task.”

While Dhollywood gives top priority to the safety of their cast and crew and makes all the right efforts to ensure a healthy and safe work environment, lack of basic studios or a centralised film body makes things tougher."

In a time when good content driven films are hard to find, a film like ‘Ahaa Re’ has done a remarkable job. After being screened at the Indian Film Festival Rome and the Habitat Film Festival, it’s no doubt a colourful feather in the cap of team ‘Ahaa Re’.

“When we started out we never thought we would receive such a great response because it’s an independent film. Frankly speaking we didn’t have the expectation that it will reach the 100 day mark. We are extremely grateful to the audience. Also I would like to give a special thanks to the producer, Rituparnadi, for having so much faith on the film,


investing in the film and obviously a big thank you to my golden team. Plus, media has also been very supportive. It’s a great feeling to reach such a milestone. I am very happy,” said Ranjan when we contacted the director over the telephone as he is right now in Arunachal for a much needed vacation.

Ahaa Re seems to have ticked all the right boxes given an unconventional premise. A rich Bangladeshi Muslim (Bangladeshi actor Arifin Shuvoo), a middle-class Indian Hindu, and the medium of food, the fusion of Epaar Bangla and Opaar Bangla, to set the course of their love story. There are some noteworthy performances to savour as well. Rituparna Sengupta has delivered with considerable restraint right through. As the old patriarch bristling at being addressed as meshomoshai, who is keen to learn magic even at this ripe old age, Paran Bandyopadhyay is exceptional."

“It was shot during the ongoing Dubai schedule with Prabhudheva taking centrestage for a minute-long solo performance, effortlessly repeating the difficult moves in a single take,” revealed a source, adding that he was joined by the film’s lead actors, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor who themselves have fond memories of the song and cheered enthusiastically when Prabhu grooved.

Bhushan Kumar who is producing the film with Divya Khosla Kumar and Lizelle D’souza recalls that ' 'Muqabala' was an instant hit back in the ’90s, breaking several records, and a quarter of a century later, is still played in the clubs. “There’s a situation in the film where we see Prabhudheva showcase his dance moves and I knew we needed to bring ‘Muqabala’ back. The audience will be blown away by the choreography and will love the new version as much as the original,” Bhushan asserts.


Apart from this number, the actors have also shot some underground dance battles and will return to Mumbai for the final schedule, media source had earlier reported (Jan 23) that the score of the 2020 Republic Day release is a mix of original compositions, folk songs and recreations. Varun and Shraddha play dancers who have grown up in the UK. The film also features Nora Fatehi, Sonam Bajwa, Dharmesh, Shakti Mohan and Vartika Jha in pivotal roles.

Naira gets up to enact the title of the movie, while Kartik decides to guess. The rest of the family members feel Kartik won't take time to answer as he has a great bond with Naira. However, he struggles to understand Naira's actions. Just then, Mihir enters and guesses the name of the movie right. This makes Kartik jealous.
Mihir then asks Manish why he had invited him. Suhasini, meanwhile, asks Samarth and Akhil to take Kartik back to his room. Naira follows them but Manish stops her. In his room, Kartik again feels hurt as Naira didn't bother to take him to his room.

Swarna, Gayu and Surekha go to the kitchen. Manish then takes Naira to a room. He tells her that he wants to talk about something urgent and that's the reason he even called Mihir home. Just then, Manish gets a call and he walks out of the room for a bit.
Meanwhile, Naira decides to call Kartik through intercom and inform him that she is with Manish. Kartik picks up the phone but by then Manish re-enters. He tells Naira that there's an important order that he has accepted from his client. He wants Mihir and her to work on it since Kartik is unwell. He also adds that Akhil and Samarth are already overworked so he didn't ask them.


Before Naira can say anything, Samarath barges in and tells Manish that Mihir wants to leave. Kartik, hence, remains unaware of Naira's reply. After Mihir goes, Manish requests Naira to accept the responsibility.


Naira tells him that Kartik is capable of handling his responsibilities, but is unable to say anything more due to Manish's plea. She agrees reluctantly.


Later in their room, Naira avoids telling Kartik anything as Manish had asked her not to. But Kartik learns of her decision after he reads Mihir's messages on her phone."

7000,"Ruman Ganguly, Zinia Sen",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,It's Byomkesh versus Byomkesh this Puja,"History repeats itself. In 2012, two Byomkesh films — both by Anjan Dutt but produced by different individuals — released together. Seven years down the line, two Byomkesh films will again clash at the box office on the biggest date of the Bengali calendar — Durga Puja. And this time too, Anjan is part of one of the films as a creative supervisor.
Only recently, it was announced that actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee has come on board Sayantan Ghoshal’s Satyanweshi Byomkesh, based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay’s Magnamainak, in which Rudranil Ghosh will be seen as his writer friend, Ajit. On Thursday, the chief of another production house announced on Twitter that their Byomkesh film with Abir Chatterjee in the lead will also release this Puja. But the twist in the tale is that it may not be directed by Arindam Sil. Rumours are rife that Birsa Dasgupta may helm the franchise from now on.

When Byomkesh was floated as a franchise in Bengal, Abir was roped in as the titular character. Later, Abir switched camps and became the protagonist in another Byomkesh franchise helmed by Arindam Sil. The latter directed films like Har Har Byomkesh, Byomkesh Pawrbo and Byomkesh Gotro. Anjan, who later made films from the same production house, also acted in Byomkesh Gotro and vouched not to direct another Byomkesh film again. Anjan, who has written the screenplay for Sayantan, told us earlier about his new role as a creative supervisor, “Five years ago, a producer friend had got the rights of a couple of Byomkesh stories to be made into Bangla films, provided they are scripted and directed by me. After that, Prabir Chakraborty, the official copyright holder, passed away. I too decided to stop making Byomkesh. I gave my NOC to him, but he sincerely needed my help to mount the project, since I started the franchise in 2009. I felt it was my duty to help him; by then, I was already acting in Arindam’s Byomkesh. I told him I will be giving him my screenplays that I had already written. But he felt that I should be the creative supervisor, since I had done a lot of research on the brand and was closely associated with Prabirda and his wife.”
Also, I am old and experienced enough to be a creative supervisor. I thought, so what if I am tired of the brand, I can always help another director who is taking up the brand afresh,” said Anjan Dutt.

The director-actor-musician was not in the know about the fresh announcement made by another production house when we spoke to him. “I don’t know about this. But even if this happens, I won’t be surprised. As an actor, I had two releases last Puja (Byomkesh Gotro and Ek Je Chhilo Raja). This year, Parambrata will have two Puja releases — Satyanweshi Byomkesh and Password. If that is not a problem, why should this be an issue? In 2012, two Byomkesh films released together. An old Byomkesh film of mine was re-released along with a new Byomkesh movie. It was not a problem at all. Also, so many people have played Byomkesh over the years and the audience still accepted everyone. Puja is a time when people go and watch films. There was a time when (Kabir) Suman, Nachiketa and I used to release albums together on Puja. I don’t see it as a problem.”


Parambrata, on his part, said, “We have had two Byomkesh films releasing on the same date before. The audience is aware. Whatever they like, they will see that. They may see both as well.” Rudranil, who is playing Ajit in Sayantan’s film, said he was not aware of another Byomkesh film releasing on the same date. “It will have the flavour of Anjanda’s classic Byomkesh films. Even if I enjoyed watching Arindamda’s Byomkesh films, I felt Ajit had nothing much to do there. Maybe, that is also why Ritwick Chakraborty left the venture and Rahul was brought in. Anjanda, on the other hand, built his brand with both Byomkesh and Ajit. About two Byomkesh films releasing together, I think it’s a strategic fight between two production houses. As actors, we have nothing to do with that. Abir was seen as Sonada (Durgeshgorer Guptodhon) and will now be seen as Byomkesh; it’s up to the audience to pass a verdict. My best wishes to the other Byomkesh team,” he said.

Though everyone from Abir’s Byomkesh team remained tight-lipped, Rahul told us, “The more the merrier as long as I get to play Ajit.” Even though Arindam is ready with the script of his next Byomkesh, sources say Birsa may just be the chosen one."

Ask the actor about the film and he smiles, “There is no connection between our film and Karthik’s Pistha (1997). The only common factor is that this one, too, will be a laugh riot.

The team is looking for a July-August release.”


Directed by Ramesh Bharathi, actresses Mridula Murali and Arundhati play the female leads.

Apparently, Shirish and Senthil didn’t have any combination scenes together in the initial version. “Senthil sir is a legendary actor. When the director first wrote the script, we didn’t have any scenes together. But he tweaked the script and gave us a few scenes together. After doing thrillers, working on this film was a different experience. Initially, I was apprehensive. I had my first few scenes with Yogi Babu and Sathish, who are quick with their comic timing.

7020,Tanvi Trivedi,Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Hard Kaur and Sameer Anjaan fight over 'Party Abhi Baaki Hai' lyrics,"Kapil Sharma’s show is in the news again. And this time around, it has nothing to do with the anchor of the show, but his guests. Last Sunday, lyricist Sameer Anjaan, who was on the show, went on to share how a song that he wrote: ‘Chaar baj gaye lekin party abhi baaki hai’, became the party anthem of the country. He also spoke of how he was inspired by his children when he first wrote this song for the film 'F.A.L.T.U' in 2010. This, however, did not go down well with hip-hop singer and rapper Hard Kaur, who has sung the song. She posted on instagram, “Wah what a f****** lie ???? I would love to know how he wrote “4 baj gaye”. Please tell us the process. #noshame taking my credit & royalties is one thing. Sitting on national TV & talking shit with such pride is just next level low (sic).”

We spoke to Hard Kaur, who is currently in the UK, and she said, “It is rare to find a rapper who will sing songs penned by another person. Most rappers pen their lyrics and sing their own songs. I got an opportunity to sing two songs in F.A.L.T.U in 2010. At that point, music composer duo Sachin-Jigar asked me to write the song and sing it. They promised me to give another opportunity soon in the future and requested me to let go of the credit for it. In a few days, Sachin-Jigar visited me and offered me to use a line for the song. They said, ‘We are giving you one line ‘Party abhi baaki hai’… and the rest you pen on your own.’ I then penned the song and also sang it. Now, after nine years, when I heard Sameer taking credit for the song, talking about getting inspired by his children and how they asked him to write something new, I was shocked. How can he do that by just taking his children’s names? Has he ever gone out and checked out in discotheques what songs youngsters like to listen to? Has he ever picked up a CD and listened to rap numbers? And he is claiming that the full song is his on national TV?”


When we contacted Sameer Anjaan, he said, “The song is mine. I don’t want to argue on this anymore.”

Composers Sachin-Jigar react to Hard Kaur’s claim


Composer duo Sachin-Jigar, however, say that it was a collaborative effort. In an exclusive statement to BT, they said, “This happened nine years ago, when we had just started our journey in Bollywood. It was a privilege to work with a rapper like Hard Kaur, and we wanted to work with her on our future projects, too. She is exceptionally talented and when we were working on the song, all of us, including Sameerji, would jam together. There were some lines that were contributed by all of us in the process and there is no denying the fact that Hard Kaur contributed to the song in a big way. We both believe that the song was a collaborative effort and the best lines were picked and that’s how the song was finally completed.”

Reacting to Sachin-Jigar's statement, Hard Kaur said, “Apart from one line, no one had given any input for the song. It is not really a team effort when I have written it alone.”"
7021,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Aditi.Pancholi@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,A lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary on Delhi stage,"Meeta Ki Kahani, directed by Sameep Singh, is a retelling of acclaimed Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar’s controversial classic titled, Mitrachi Goshta (A Friend’s Story). Written in 1974, it is the first Indian play on the same-sex relationship. With Rohini Hattangadi in the lead, the play witnessed empty halls when it premiered in 1981. The actress had said in an interview, “In those days, nobody talked, let alone or put up a play on the subject.” With Supreme Court decriminalising same-sex relationships between consensual adults, last September, the theme of the play, which was earlier considered a social taboo, has now become even more relevant. Meeta Ki Kahani is a lesbian love story that breaks the typical ‘ladka-ladki’ binary as here ek ladki (Meeta) falls in love with another ladki (Nama). It is a story about three college students – the diffident and sympathetic Shrikant Marathe aka Bapu (Ashutosh Singh Rathor), cool, carefree and casually rebellious Sumitra Dev aka Meeta (Alqama Khatoon), and enigmatic Nama Deshmukh (Jyoti Rana). Bapu is smitten by Meeta, who is sexually attracted to Nama, who reciprocates her feelings but in a repressed form. Due to the lack of a support system from her peers and openness about alternate sexuality in those times, a conflicted, confused, vulnerable and strong-willed Meeta turns destructive and suicidal.

YOU'VE GOT MY BACK, BRO: Pandey ji bantering with his roommate, Bapu


One of the highlights of the play is that it makes us empathise for each of its characters and understand their dilemmas. The inner turmoil of a lonely, confused, abhored and abused individual trying to fit in the society is quite gripping and well portrayed by Alqama. Jyoti, who plays Nama, is equally impressive in her depiction of a young girl who wants to break free from the shackles of her conservative family and possessive boyfriend. Ashutosh as selfless and caring Bapu, who is hopelessly in love with Meeta, and somebody who is trying to make sense of his friend’s sexuality, delivers an impactful performance. The supporting cast, including Maneesh Sharma and Kirti, are equally good in their roles of light-hearted, fitness-obsessed, flirt rommate and a jilted, possessive boyfriend, respectively. The play highlights sexism and homophobia prevalent in our country. What also caught attention was the fact that the narration of the play done by Bapu was pre-recorded and played via a projector, making it a multimedia production.

Sameep Singh, director of the play


Meeta Ki Kahani is a tale about friendship, love, obsession, jealousy, betrayal and a search for redemption. It aims at normalising same sex relationships and does it tactfully. If you want to watch a powerful play that tackles an unconventional topic, without being preachy, don’t miss Meeta Ki Kahani the next time it’s in town."

7026,Soumya Vajpayee,Soumya Vajpayee,Entertainment,Theatre review: Eidgah ke Jinnat,"Director: Abhishek Majumdar

Duration: 2 hours
Cast: Abhinav Bhal, Ajeet Singh Palawat, Ashwath Bhatt, Aqib Mirza and others Language: Hindi, Urdu
Rating: 4 / 5

Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah Ke Jinnat is the Hindi-Urdu version of his contemporary classic, The Djinns of Eidgah. With a hard-hitting subject and blazing performances by the cast, the play doesn’t allow the spectators to digress. The fact that the play’s sold-out show was called off in Jaipur two months ago after a few protestors stormed the venue and alleged that it called the Indian security forces in Kashmir draconian and depicted them in a bad light is unfortunate. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic storytelling, the play showcases a simple story of a radicalised generation of kids in Kashmir and how things become difficult for them, thanks to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and the army’s constant intervention.


The story revolves around Ashrafi and her 18-year-old brother, Bilal, who are orphaned siblings, stranded and defined by the troubles in Kashmir. Bilal is part of a teenage football team, and hopes to play on an international level and settle with his sister abroad. He is pushed to the limits by the violence around them.


Though the story is based in the picturesque valleys of Kashmir, it’s the breath of life that helps people connect to the characters. The spontaneity, coordination and performances by the cast deserve applause. Dr Asif Beg, played by Ashwath, adds a placatory layer to the narrative of the act.

A lot of attention has been given to the lighting and music of this play. The work by sound designer Nikhil Nagaraj and lighting and music designer Rajesh Singh is truly commendable. While the music is dramatic and takes the story forward, the lighting depicts the mood of the scenes and transforms the small performance area into Kashmir.


Though the dialogues in the play feature rich Hindi and Urdu terms, the writer makes sure that even those with minimal knowledge of Urdu don’t struggle to comprehend. The beauty of writing lies in the fact that the dialogues don’t become jarring at any point in the play."

7030,Rashmi Uday Singh,Rashmi Uday Singh,Lifestyle,Restaurant Review: Hitchki,"I’m in Thane! It’s a refreshing daylight bathed room, rocking with a buzz so thick that I can slice it and pop it into my ‘Dragon fruit Mojito’ and ‘Nacho Nacho’ with it. Innovation, playfulness bubbles over in every plate and Thane is lapping it up. I walk in without a reservation with my partner in crime. Alas! Not Kunal Vijayakar this time. This one is a seasoned well-travelled gourmet, who loves to eat, cook, golf and workout (in that order) and his international code name is Dunkel Kurbis. Our review follows...
DÉCOR
Pleasant, pleasant surprise. Greenery peeping in from the large picture windows. Old fashioned fans with bulbs. Black and white flooring. Well-stocked bar. Happy buzz. Packed. Rectangular black plates and movie clapper boards all over.


FOOD Gimmicky, clever names with puns sprinkle the menu. Kha---muuuush is actually a moist, intense mushroom galoti kabab. Charlie chapli kababs are delicious, boldly spiced mutton kababs.
Can a fiery red chatpata momo actually taste good? Would it be a good idea to ask for a dish name ‘Gassi to phassi’? The answer is yes in both cases. The soft sphere of a momo sparkles with chatpatta spices and that thick gassi reaches all corners of the palate with it’s rich coconuttiness. Homestyle rajma served in a pressure cookers warms my Punjabi heart and the khichiya papad hits the sweet spot with my Gujarati buddy. Flamboyant, over the top desserts. ‘Jungle main mangal’ is a tray full of black forest gulab jamun, covered in chocolate. Sagar Dhanawade takes amazing care of all in the restaurant.

MINUS POINTS
Sadly, there hiccups and hitchkis in many a dish. Overcooked, over-salted, unhappy mixed marriages fighting on the plate and the palate. ‘Yeh to hona hi tha’ is a stodgy pani puri pakoda. Lacklustre, Savji mutton and over-sweet, over-worked desserts. ‘Tareekh pe tareekh’ a case in point. Many a dish not available — ‘Ulta Punjab’, ‘Ja surmai ja’ and a few others.

MY POINT
What you see in the photograph is our lunch table for two. What you don’t see in it is the vibrant buzz, the refreshing daylit space and the happy lunch crowd. Mixed marriages on the plate, some happy, some shrieking divorce. Rajma in a pressure cooker to Thalaiya dimum, but in many a dish there is high impact flavour. Low impact prices. It’s not for the purist, nor for the old at heart. While it doesn’t merit a special trip, should you happen to be in Thane, don’t forget to visit Hitchki.

BE MY FOODIE BLIND DATE
This is it. This is why I love my work as food critic — to connect with and meet foodies I’ve never met before, to feel the foodie pulse of the city through them, to discover new places, to get their reactions and of course, I absolutely love meeting them. Over the years, I’ve connected with them even before there was internet Amazing Arif Memon and his wife took me on a memorable round of Mohammed Ali road eateries and roadside gems. The lovely Jyoti Kasliwal shared her favourite Rajasthani joints bakers and more. I’m forever grateful to the forever helpful Shilpa Chawla; the seasoned foodie who walks the talk, Kalyan Karmakar (aka Marlon Brando) and Jumana Huzefa Electricwala, a multi-dimensional creative energy. My latest charmers Aaditya Bhat and Moumita Sriram, poetic Utkarsha Kesarkar... each one is a gem. Over the years, my foodie blind dates have been from Malabar hill and Cuffe Parade to Jogeshwari and from Ghatkopar to Khar. Grateful to Jigar Parmar, Mohit Chatrani, Hunaina Sonsara, Pooja Dharani, Shayan Italia, Ritika Betala, Shabnam Mukadam, Sanjana, Samina Patel, Diane D’Costa, Aaron Pereira and Bhumika Thakkar.

7031,Neha Maheshwri,Neha Maheshwri,TV,TV comedian Sidharth Sagar’s fiancée Subuhi Joshi accuses him of domestic violence,"Television couple Sidharth Sagar and Subuhi Joshi, who exchanged rings in November last year, have now called off their engagement. While Subuhi has accused him of physical abuse, he blames the break-up on incompatibility. Incidentally, Sidharth, who became a household name with shows like 'Comedy Circus' and 'The Kapil Sharma Show', was in the news a year ago, when he was battling depression and also had a public fallout with his mother. Sidharth and Subuhi first met in 2014, after which they started dating. But the couple split in 2016, only to get back together last year. They started living in and even took their relationship to the next level by getting engaged, five months ago. However, events took an ugly turn soon after.
Subuhi, who has been a part of TV shows like 'Comedy Classes', 'Bh Se Bhade' and 'Love Dosti Dua', alleges, “When we separated in 2016, he blamed his mother for it. However, she wasn’t entirely responsible for what happened; I realised it only after staying with him post our engagement. The problem is with his attitude and behaviour, but I did try my best to save the relationship. I have seen his dark side; he loses his cool over petty issues, and can get violent. Woh haath uthaata hai aur cheezein phekta hai.”

She says that she even had to call the cops once after Sidharth hit her. She recalls, “He was disturbed as he was going through a financial crunch. Besides fighting verbally, he would often raise his hand on me. In March, I called the cops after he hit me. I was taken to the hospital for a medical check-up and on our way to the police station, he kept crying saying, ‘Mujhse galti ho gayi, maaf kar de. I’ll never repeat it’. After seeing him cry, I told the cops to let him go. In hindsight, I feel that I made a huge mistake. He should have been behind bars.”

They have not been in touch for almost two months now. Subuhi says, “I would have liked to end this relationship on a cordial note, but Sidharth is an escapist. When he doesn’t want to face something, he runs away from it. This is exactly what he did with his mother. Now, he has disappeared on me. A few weeks ago, I messaged him about his creditors coming to my home, after which he blocked me on his phone and social media handles. His important documents also bear my residential address and I don’t want to take his responsibility now.”


Sidharth, however, has a different story to tell. He says, “Subuhi and I are no longer together, we have called off our engagement. We had parted ways in 2016, because of my mother, as she wasn’t in favour of this relationship. However, Subuhi reconnected with me last year, and we got back together. Everything was going good, but then compatibility issues cropped up. We called off our engagement two-and-a-half months ago.”


He adds, “Things were fine between us till the time I was working and making money. I feel that problems cropped up after I faced a financial crisis. Your state of mind changes when you are not working, and I was troubled at that time. We were having a lot of fights and I felt it was better to end the relationship.”


Reacting to the accusations levelled by Subuhi, Sidharth says, “I have been through a lot in life and still get pangs of depression. I realised that I didn’t have the tenacity to handle more ups and downs in the relationship. About the incident when she called the cops, we had an argument and she hit me first. My nose started bleeding. She wasn’t leaving me and in an attempt to release myself, I moved her away from from me. She could have got hurt in that process. I fled the house forgetting my phone behind. When I came back to collect my phone, she had already called the cops. I could have done that, too, but I didn’t want the matter to escalate. I even told her to end the relationship that day, because it had reached an ugly stage. Given my mental state, it will take me some time to be fine. I would often tell her that I needed my space even if we were in a relationship, as that’s normal. But that, too, was an issue. As far as blocking her is concerned, she blocked me first. I did it later as I wanted some peace in my life.”"

Neha Dhupia blames Prince and Nikhil for their increasing alliance,"Roadies Real Heroes is up for a dramatic weekend this week as equations between the contestants and the gang leaders are turning sour. It begins with Rannvijay asking the gang leaders to advice Sohail on which contestants’ immunity should he choose for the week.

An upset Neha taunts Sohail, ”Koi faayda nahi hota hai pehle bolne ka, yeh log apne aap hi decide karke aa jaate sab kuch, do baar meine chitthi faad kar uska naam likha, but koi baat nahi, ziddi mein bhi hu, jab waqt aayega tab mein bhi zidd par atak jaaungi.” (She comments on the growing alliance between Prince and Nikhil)


This doesn’t go down well with Prince and they get into a heated argument, “Agar Neha ko aapki zarurat thi, toh who pehle bhi aapko le sakti thi, unke pass option tha.” (if Neha really needed you in her team she could have called you in her team long back)

The gang leaders are divided on this. Raftaar and Sandeep come in Neha’s support, while Nikhil supports Prince. Neha and Prince both blame each other for making an alliance. To top it all, the gang leaders – Raftaar and Sandeep lose their cool on Tarun-Tara for supporting Prince and getting manipulated by him. Will the intense competition change the equations between the gang leaders?"

7127,"Created: May 31, 2019, 06:00 IST",-,Entertainment,I’m on my most memorable holiday right now; next stop is London for the World Cup: Mahesh Babu,"There is a spring in Mahesh Babu’s step as he unwinds in spectacular European locales with his family. He’s in celebration mode. and why not? his film Maharshi continues to shatter records at the BO. Not only is it the biggest hit of his career, it’s being brandished as “the biggest hit in Telugu cinema after the Baahubali”. Meanwhile, the Superstar is making the most of his “most memorable holiday”. Speaking to Hyderabad Times from Europe, the actor says, “As you can see from my social media posts, I’m thoroughly enjoying the time out with my family in Europe. We’re all celebrating the success of Maharshi. We’re now headed to London because Gautam wants to see a World Cup match live in the stadium,” he says, smiling.
More than the staggering box-office collections, Mahesh says the fact that the film resonated with the audience has been immensely satisfying.

“Our hard work has paid off. When a film works, you feel happy, but when a film connects with the people, you get a high that is unparalleled,” says the superstar, adding, “The entire journey has also been special because I’ve gotten closer to the people involved in making Maharshi. My bond with Vamshi in particular has been special. I’m really proud of him for the kind of film he’s made. We’ll be working together again very soon.” While Mahesh is chilling in Europe, back home, here in Hyderabad, his dad turns 75 today! The actor may not be around to celebrate with him, but he’s making the day special with the announcement of his next film directed by Anil Ravipudi. “My father watches all my films. He’s been proud of every single performance of mine. It makes me really happy to hear his words of praise; it means a lot. He always likes to be updated about the work I am doing and whenever we meet, all we discuss is films,” he says, adding, “My father has always been my hero and my inspiration. I have grown up watching his films and I’m really, really proud of him. I am what I am today only because of him and I wish him nothing but the best of everything for his 75th.” Talking about the film, Mahesh tells us, “It’s a thorough entertainer. The script is great and it’s something very different from what I have done in my last couple of films. I’m very excited and I’m looking forward to starting the film soon.”"

7130,Soumayani Ghoshal,Soumayani Ghoshal,Entertainment,Food trippin’ in Old City,"There is less than a week to go for Eid and streets of Old City are buzzing with an air of bonhomie. As soon as the sun sets behind the Mecca Masjid, the Maghrib azaan resonates through the summer air and the narrow gallis of Charminar turn into a spectacle that seduces all your senses. The dazzling bangles of Laad Bazaar, a slew of dimly-lit, make-shift carts selling an array of things and the clay bhattis churning out bowls of the world-famous haleem on every corner — there is chaos and magic playing out everywhere you see. And savouring the mouth-watering delicacies in such a surreal ambience is a yearly Ramzan ritual that thousands of foodies swear by. Hyderabad Times soaks in the food frenzy of kebabs and paya, parathas and nihari, phirnis and faloodas to raise a toast to Alvida Jumma. Here is a lowdown on everything you need to try…Bon appetit!
Chicken pav A superior cousin of Mumbai ka vada pav, this dish is basically a chicken burger but with a desi twist. The vada is made of minced chicken cooked on a tawa in a tangy tomato curry with just the right amount of spices and then stuffed inside a buttery pav. Sounds yum, doesn’t it? “I sell chicken pav all throughout the summer but the month of Ramzan is when its sale peaks. Once, even actor Aamir Khan visited our stall to try it out,” boasts Ahmer, the shop owner as he points at a picture of Aamir biting into a chicken pav hung on his cart. Ahmer then flips a pav on the tawa and fills it up with a generous helping of the flavourful chicken kheema — it was love at first bite!

Chicken stick

Crispy, scrumptious and unique — this stick is a great snack on the go if you plan to bustle through the busy streets of Charminar and satiate your taste buds at the same time. Chicken strips smothered in spicy masalas, soaked in flour and sev for the crunch and then pronged on a stick before being deep fried in oil, this snack is a must-try. “People buy 10 or 12 at a time and come back for more because these are yummy and super easy on the pocket,” smiles Kazim, who has been in the business for over 10 years now. And guess what, we did go back for more.

Pathar-ka-gosht

The baap of Dakhani cuisine, this dish is a traditional Hyderabadi delicacy and a Ramzan specialty. Tender, succulent mutton pieces marinated with kebab chini, shah zeera, garam masala, chili powder and other spices and then slow-roasted over a granite slab with pure ghee — it’s a dish that surpasses all in terms of taste. “We have been making pathar-ka-gosht for over 40 years now. This is a special kind of granite slab and takes around an hour to heat up before we roast the meat on it. We have people from across the country and abroad come to try this. It is definitely our top-selling item,” says Amjad, as he hands us a plateful straight from the slab. It tastes heavenly with a mint chutney dip.
Malai marag

An aromatic, creamy mutton soup with tender mutton pieces floating in the broth, topped with some cashew, mint leaves and fried onions — malai marag is a warm hug served in a bowl. The mutton pieces melt in your mouth instantly and every spoon is a burst of flavours. “I have been coming here every year since the past three years for the marag, It’s a specialty prepared on auspicious occasions such as Ramzan,” says Akhil, who travels from Gachibowli to Charminar every year for a steaming bowl of marag, malai maar ke.

Kuch meetha ho jaaye?

A dessert is a must after every meal, so as soon as we spotted a street vendor selling kulhads with chilled kesar rabdi, we couldn’t help but get our hands on them. A thick and rich sweet dish with dry fruits, malai and saffron, the kesar rabdi with some hot jalebis is a treat to your taste buds. But we didn’t stop just at just that — as there was mango malai on offer. A few squarely cut mangoes with a rich and creamy layer of malai on top, this was a win! And so was its blueberry variant. We finally ended the trail with our favourite, the Hyderabadi phirni — a pudding flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios and almonds. This dessert definitely satisfied our sweet craving."

7220,-,-,Lifestyle,Weight loss: Your cup of coffee may help you cut down fat!,"Coffee is the most popular and loved beverage across the globe. People in every part of the world reach out for a warm cup of coffee every morning to kick-start their day. Coffee is soothing and an excellent-to-have beverage when you are feeling stressed. But apart from this, a cup of decaf can even help in weight management. So, if you are a coffee lover, here is how coffee can help you to reach your weight loss goal.
How coffee helps in weight loss
People have mixed opinions when it comes to coffee intake. Like every other thing, drinking coffee also has its own share of advantages and disadvantages.

Low in calories
When trying to shed kilos, it is crucial to create a calorie deficit. This target can be achieved either by increasing your physical activity or by consuming fewer calories. But coffee is a low-calorie beverage; one cup of black coffee i.e.: 240 ml, contains only 2 calories. So, you can easily replace soda, juice or chocolate milk with a cup of black coffee.
Boosts metabolism
Coffee is both mood and metabolism booster. The caffeine present in a cup of black coffee is the highest as compared to other beverages. A cup of black coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine, but this differs depending on the type of coffee beans, roasting style and preparation method. Caffeine intake helps to improve your metabolism, which is another reason why it can be included when trying to lose weight.

Suppresses appetite

Caffeine may also suppress your appetite and reduce your level of hunger. Studies show that drinking coffee may reduce your calorie intake throughout the day. However, the research is quite conflicting and more work is needed in this area.


How coffee can be harmful

Sipping coffee can even lead to weight gain and other problems, if it is not consumed in the right way.

- At the end of the day, we cannot deny the fact that coffee contains caffeine, which can disturb your sleep cycle.

- Pairing your coffee with a pastry or other sugary food items can lead to weight gain.


How to drink coffee without gaining weight

If you are someone who sips two-three cups of coffee in a day, then try to switch to black coffee. Black coffee without any additional ingredients is very low in calories and may help to manage your weight. If you are concerned about the bitter taste of black coffee, then sprinkle some cinnamon, add unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk for flavour.

Also, try to stick two-three cups of coffee in a day. For more effective results, drink only homemade coffee and be mindful about the ingredients when you order it in a restaurant."

7271,"Updated: Jun 21, 2019, 13:48 IST",-,Entertainment,Yuyutsu is a well-knit socio-cultural satire on patriarchy,"Yuyutsu, a socio-cultural modern satire inspired from real life events with a deep rooting in epics like The Mahabharata was premiered in Ahmedabad recently.
Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

Written and directed by Harsh Shodhan, this suspense thriller in khadi Hindi dialect for the audience above the age of 16 looks at topics ranging from sex education, family planning, rural-urban disparity, khap panchayat, gender, caste and racial discrimination, besides acid attack, girl child education and menstruation.

Jatin Mishra (Pratik Nanda) is from a middle class family too burdened by his dominating ever-swearing chappal-yielding father’s (Chetan Daiya) expectations who thinks he is good for nothing. However, his perception is at the brink of change with the underdog Jatin and his 40-year-old wife Janki all set to embrace parenthood for the second time, 15 years after their daughter was born.
Except two scenes, almost all scenes in the play that is laced with humour unfold in a hospital near the labour room that is a subtext for Kurukshetra as the staunch patriarch who represents Shakuni, Duryodhana and Bhishma awaits arrival of a baby boy and even calls a sangeet mandli to set the ‘right mood’.
Though used as a metaphor for the society, the mandli with Nirav Barot on harmonium and Karan Gajjar on dhol attracts lots of applause. The various melodious remixes from time to time in the play range from Jiyo ho Bihar k lala to Bas tum hi ho.

Among all, mandli dancer Smit Joshi steals the show with his moves, apt timing and costume while providing comic relief. His jugalbandi with Jatin’s independent corporator friend Gagan Sinha who represents Arjuna as well as unsung hero Yuyutsu enacted by Palkesh Agarwal is something to watch out for.
As you leave the auditorium, the words of Janki who represents both Draupadi and Kunti ring in your ears, “ Ladai kabhi satya aur asatya ki nahi hoti. Vo hamesha sach aur jyada sach ki hoti hai.” The play gives a strong social message of women empowerment just the way Gagan says, “ Lao ladka, raho kadka. Kismat chamki, aayi ladki.”


The complex modern play with too many layers keeps you on the edge. However, the use of too many cuss words could have been avoided.

The play also gives you a feeling of watching a sitcom with the way credits are announced after a few scenes.

All said, Yuyutsu will stir your heart just the way it will leave a smile on your face.

Most people in Indian begin their day with a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. For some people their day is simply incomplete without that daily ritual, but have you ever wondered, how it is affecting your body.
Undeniably, to kick start your day, and especially for your mind it works as a relaxant, but as far as the health aspect is concerned, sipping down on coffee or tea can actually lead to bloating, acidity, gastritis and in the long term can lead to liver issues and a few other lifestyle disorders.


Here are a few foods you must avoid eating on an empty stomach
Coffee
Many people wake up to a hearty cup of coffee and their day seems incomplete without it. This idea is so deep rooted that changing this habit might take eternity, but the sooner, the better. No wonder, it gives you that instant kick to start your day, but at the same time it leads to secretion of hydrochloric acid in the digestive system, which further causes gastritis, bloating and acidity.

Spicy food

There are many people who gorge on leftover delicacies in the morning before heading to a long day of work. The problem here is not with the leftover food rather what can lead to a bad stomach day is the spice content in the food. Eating spicy and rich food early morning can make you feel bloated and can irritate your stomach lining. The presence of too much spice in the first meal of the day can lead to acidity and stomach pain.



Sugary drinks and foods

Many people drink fruit juice on an empty stomach, which overburdens your liver and pancreas with excess fructose. After long hours of rest, the pancreas is active and the more sugar you eat, it overloads your liver. Hence, avoiding sugary foods and drinks in the morning is the key to good health. Moreover, processed foods with sugar should be avoided as they can spike sugar levels instantly and overload the liver.


Citrus fruits

Eating citrus fruits on an empty stomach can increase the production of acid in the body. Apart from that it can also lead to bloating. The presence of fructose in the citrus fruits can impact your digestion. Avoiding too much of citrus fruits and fibers will leave you feeling full for the entire day."
